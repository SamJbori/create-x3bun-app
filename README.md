# X3Bun Starter

<h1 align="center">
  create-x3bun-app
</h1>

An opinionated template for high performance apps, build to use **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)**

### **Runtime**

Due to its high performance and excellent developer experience, this stack is built **exclusively on [Bun](https://bun.sh/)**.  
All tooling, scripts, and runtime assumptions are designed to work with **Bun** and are not intended to be used with Node.js.

---

### **The 3 Xs**

- **[Expo](https://expo.dev/)**  
  A powerful **React Native framework** used to build high-quality, cross-platform **mobile applications** from a single codebase.

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**  
  A modern **React framework** for building fast, scalable **web applications**, enhanced with **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for efficient and consistent UI development.

- **[Hono](https://hono.dev/)**  
  A lightweight, high-performance **backend framework** designed for speed and simplicity, providing a faster and more efficient alternative to **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**, especially in edge and serverless environments.

---

### **Packages**

- **Authentication**  
  Implemented using **[Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/)** to provide secure and flexible authentication flows.

- **API**  
  Built with **[tRPC](https://trpc.io/)**, enabling a fully type-safe RPC-based API with end-to-end TypeScript inference.

- **State Management**  
  Powered by **[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)** for efficient server-state management, caching, and synchronization.

- **Storage**  
  Uses **[S3-compatible storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)**, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of cloud and self-hosted storage providers.

### Usage

Create a new project using the interactive CLI:

```bash
# Create a new X3Bun app
